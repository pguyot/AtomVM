    <h1>Run script example</h1>
    <p>
      This example demonstrates calling <code>emscripten:run_script/1</code> and
      <code>emscripten:run_script/2</code> to run Javascript from Erlang.
    </p>

    <p>It runs four Javascript scripts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One script from the main thread, synchronously, that prints a line to the console and displays an alert</li>
      <li>One script from the main thread, asynchronously, that prints a line to the console and displays an alert</li>
      <li>One script from the worker thread that prints a line to the console</li>
      <li>One script that updates the DOM to display the time required for first script to run</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      On non-SMP builds, it demonstrates the fact that Erlang continues to run
      when <code>emscripten:run_script/2</code> is called with
      <code>[main_thread]</code> as a counter is incremented while waiting for
      first line to be printed. The value is <span id="demo-counter">unset</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond the counter, this example also demonstrates manipulating DOM (in
      the main thread) using JS function.
    </p>

    <script>
      // Arguments are loaded using fetch API.
      // wasm_webserver serves under /build/ files in build subdirectory.
      var Module = {
        arguments: ["/build/examples/emscripten/run_script.avm"],
      };
    </script>
    <script async src="/AtomVM.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
